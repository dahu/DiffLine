 1. INTRODUCTION                                          *DiffLine-intro*

DiffLine is a Vim plugin for zooming in on the differences within a
single line of a diff session. Typically this would be used on 'very'
long lines where the differences might not even appear on screen.

DiffLine is intended to be called from within an existing |vimdiff|
session, with two windows open to differing versions of a file and the
cursor in each window on the common line of interest.

NOTE: This will be the case in a typical |vimdiff| or |diffthis| setup after
you've navigated to the line/diff/change of interest.

 2. COMMANDS                                              *DiffLine-commands*

|:DiffLine| [split-pattern]	Diff the current line in a new tab.
|:DiffLineClose|		Close a DiffLine tab.

                                                          *:DiffLine*

NOTE: The |:DiffLine| command is intended to be run from within an existing
|vimdiff| session with two windows showing differences between two files.

|:DiffLine| will open a new tab with two windows showing the differences of the
original line (from both files) after being split with the user-provided pattern
(whitespace by default).

                                                          *:DiffLineClose*

|:DiffLineClose| will close the DiffLine tab, deleting its associated temporary
files.

NOTE: You should call |:DiffLineClose| instead of manually closing the tabe with
|:tabclose| to ensure that the associated temporary files are deleted.
