DiffLine
--------

__Diff the Diffs on Just This Line__

DiffLine is a Vim plugin for zooming in on the differences within a
single line of a diff session. Typically this would be used on _very_
long lines where the differences might not even appear on screen.

DiffLine is intended to be called from within an existing vimdiff
session, with two windows open to differing versions of a file and the
cursor in each window on the common line of interest. NOTE: This will be
the case in a typical `vimdiff` or `diffthis` setup after you've
navigated to the line/diff/change of interest.

=== Commands

`:DiffLine [split-pattern]` :: Opens a new tab containing a side-by-side
                               diff view of the source line split
                               according to the optional
                               `split-pattern`, which is _whitespace_ by
                               default.

\:DiffLineClose` :: Closes a DiffLine tab. Use this command instead of
                    manually closing the tab with `:tabclose` because
                    DiffLine uses temporary files which should be
                    deleted on close.

=== Maps

The following normal mode maps are provided by default and can be
overridden with the corresponding plug maps.

* `<leader>dll` (<plug>diffline) calls `:DiffLine` with the default _whitespace_ split-pattern.
* `<leader>dlc` (<plug>difflineclose) calls `:DiffLineClose`

=== Functions

The following function forms are also available:

* ``DiffLine( split-pattern = '\s\+' )``
* ``DiffLineClose()``
